1) Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

Displaying "golfers" table:

sqlite> SELECT * FROM golfers;

1|Lion Forrest|2|true|2
2|John T Box|4|false|1
3|Fair Weigh|7|false|2
4|Sandy Bunker|1|true|3
5|Dan Bogeys|6|false|4

2) Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

Updating "John T Box's" handicap to 6:

sqlite> UPDATE golfers SET handicap=6 WHERE name="John T Box";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM golfers;

1|Lion Forrest|2|true|2
2|John T Box|6|false|1
3|Fair Weigh|7|false|2
4|Sandy Bunker|1|true|3
5|Dan Bogeys|6|false|4


3) Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM golfers, courses WHERE golfers.course_id = courses.id;

1|Lion Forrest|2|true|2|2|Scottish Highlands|71|false
2|John T Box|6|false|1|1|Green Meadow CC|72|true
3|Fair Weigh|7|false|2|2|Scottish Highlands|71|false
4|Sandy Bunker|1|true|3|3|Trull Brook CC|72|false
5|Dan Bogeys|6|false|4|4|Nashua CC|70|true

4) Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

Display golfer names and if the course they belong to is a private course (true):

sqlite> SELECT golfers.name, courses.private FROM golfers, courses WHERE golfers.course_id = courses.id;

Lion Forrest|false
John T Box|true
Fair Weigh|false
Sandy Bunker|false
Dan Bogeys|true

5) Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

Handicaps of 7 and over are too high and those players are removed from the grouping.  Fair Weigh to be removed:

sqlite> DELETE FROM golfers WHERE handicap > 6;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM golfers;
   
1|Lion Forrest|2|true|2
2|John T Box|6|false|1
4|Sandy Bunker|1|true|3
5|Dan Bogeys|6|false|4


-----RELEASE 3 JOINs------

--- Running multiple conditions.  Display golfers and the course name where the courses are private memberships:

sqlite> SELECT golfers.name, courses.name FROM golfers JOIN courses ON (golfers.course_id = courses.id and courses.private = "true");

John T Box|Green Meadow CC
Dan Bogeys|Nashua CC 

--- Running the same query with a LEFT JOIN, prints all rows from first table (table listed after FROM) and only the items from the second table that meet conditions:

sqlite> SELECT golfers.name, courses.name FROM golfers LEFT JOIN courses ON (golfers.course_id = courses.id and courses.private = "true");

Lion Forrest|
John T Box|Green Meadow CC
Sandy Bunker|
Dan Bogeys|Nashua CC 

--- A RIGHT JOIN can be run to mirror the LEFT JOIN where the first table is item is blank on when condition is met.  I ran this and got this error:

Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

--- A FULL JOIN prints every instance where a condition is met, including all the NULL values
