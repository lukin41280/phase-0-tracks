Phase 4 - GPS 1.2

- semantic tags gives a webpage meaning and seperates different levels of content to make accessibility tools work correctly.  I think article tag is very useful since it specifies that the content is not your own.  header is also useful since it should be used to discribe the next part of content

-basic flow of a web page seems to be first a header, then content with potential articles, paragraphs, tables, etc.  Possibly an aside next to the main content.  Then a footer can be added at the bottom of the page

- Sublime is very robust.  It goes beyond being a text editor.  Snippets can be used to replicate tasks.  Yes I love the idea of the snippet and plan to create some as I go on
</p>
<p>
- I did not have much difficulty with this challenge.  The only part that I will need to work on is when to use certain tags such as div or section but it seems there is no set way so it will be a matter of creating a consistency in my HTML
