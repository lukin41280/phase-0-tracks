1) Locate at least 2 doc pages for jQuery - syntax is my biggest hurdle, so this will help as a guide

2) Go thru docs and test out some code/methods/etc to see results - the best way for me to learn is to make 
   errors and see WHY code behaves the way it does

3) Do a search for best practices in jQuery - this should bring about conventions and no-no's 

4) Find some tutorials to practice jQuery - I want to try working backwards to see if I can understand the
   information as it is presented in the docs first before I have a step by step telling of what to do
   and why.


At first I did a search of simply what jQuery was and what it was useful for.  This gave me a sense of what I was getting into.  I then looked up the jQuery docs and started parusing around.  I found that simply looking at docs does nothing for me.  I could make some sense out of what the code examples were telling me, but I had no start reference point.  It was like looking at Italian for the first time and trying to understand what each word meant with no knowledge of what the letters mean.  I found myself gearing towards tutorials and starting from the beginning and working my way through each step.  This really started to make things clear and getting some hands on practice made the learning much easier.  After I had a good sense of what jQuery was all about, I searched some best practices and thankfully nearly all the points made sense to me in what they were addressing.
